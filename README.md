<h1>Turbo Racer - XCOM</h1>

#### Project Description

We have made a 2D top-down racing game which includes an AI component as an opponent. The game has three different game modes, such as the user playing against the AI, another player or a time trial against themselves. The game also has randomly generated tracks and the option to choose between racing cars for each player.

#### Installation

Using the maven command line tools inside the git repo:\
<code>mvn compile</code>\
<code>mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="sample.Main"
